# AWS-Security-Analyst-Vulnerability-Management

## Project Description

In this project I deployed a VM in AWS featuring disabled firewalls, outdated software, and security misconfigurations.
I then Utilized Amazon Inspector to scan for host and network vulnerabilities, recording the results. I then used GuardDuty to scan for any malware in the VM.
After Analyzing the scan results, I performed a series of remediation techniques to secure my EC2 instance.

Tools Used: AWS Inspector, GuardDuty, Firewalls, EC2 Virtual Machine, Security Groups
